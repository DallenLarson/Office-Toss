# Starting a new visionOS project from the Immersive App Template
<a name="starting-a-new-visionos-mr-project-from-the-project-template"></a>

Unity’s [visionOS Template](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oe-6bBCCmk7okbK832HWiYFbM8mV0XrZ) provides a starting point for visionOS development in Unity. The template configures project settings, pre-installs the right XR related packages, and includes various pre-configured Example Assets to demonstrate how to set up a project that is ready to deploy to visionOS.

For more information on hardware and Unity version requirements visit [Requirements](Requirements.md)

The visionOS Template demonstrates:

* Virtual Environment
* Mixed Reality Environment
* Shared World Environment
* Multi-mode and Responsive Layout
* XR Input and Interactions

## Using the Template Quick Start

To use the visionOS project template, follow these steps:

* Install Unity 2022.3 LTS and make sure you target the visionOS build target.
* Download the zipped [visionOS template project here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oe-6bBCCmk7okbK832HWiYFbM8mV0XrZ), and unzip to your desired file location.
* Use the Unity Hub to `Add project from disk`, targeting that unzipped location.
* In the template, you will be led through next steps via the In-Editor Tutorial.
  * Go to `Tutorials > Show Tutorials` if the tutorial does not show up automatically.

<!--
* From the Unity Hub, click the dropdown next to New and create a new project in Unity 2022 LTS.
* Select the visionOS template and name your Project.
* Click Create.
* After your Project has been created, from Unity’s main menu, go to **Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt;> XR Plug-in Management &gt; visionOS SDK**, and select the platforms you plan to deploy to.
* Make sure **rendering** and quality settings are optimized for your target platform. See the **Rendering and quality settings** table on this page.

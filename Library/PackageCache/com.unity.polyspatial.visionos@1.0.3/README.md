# Unity PolySpatial -- Apple visionOS support

The visionOS package for PolySpatial includes platform-specific support for visionOS and the Apple Vision Pro headset. 

## Platform Info
For a user-friendly introduction to visionOS and Unity PolySpatial, consult the [visionOS Introduction and Overview](Documentation~/index.md).

### System Requirements
Building for visionOS and Apple Vision Pro currently requires a Mac computer running Apple Silicon with Xcode 15.1 Beta 1 installed. 

### Building for visionOS
This package introduces a new platform (visionOS) to the Unity build window (currently only shown on Mac). Select a destination folder and trigger a build; when the build completes, Unity will open a Finder window containing the build and an Xcode project (just as for iOS). Open this project and ensure you are targeting a visionOS simulator or device, then press the play button to build and launch.
